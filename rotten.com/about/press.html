<b>a photo is posted</b>

<p>
<p>
On September 12 we received an email containing an image
of a car accident matching most of the characteristics from
the crash Diana Spencer was killed from. The image contained
an inset and the caption <i>Death of a Princess</i>.
<p>
<center>
<img src="pirelli.jpg">
</center>
<p>
Careful analysis of the image showed that, while the photograph
had not been tampered with, a few minor points were "wrong".
We confirmed the source of the image within 12 hours, but
because of the wide interest in the existence of any such image
(real or not), we went live with it.
<p>
It got the world's panties in a bunch, to say the least. The
combination of the apparently real photo, plus the "Princess
Pirelli" image (Diana with tire tracks across her face) can be 
most upsetting to the uninitiated. 
<p>
<i>At no time did we actually claim the photo was genuine.</i>
Of course, once we receive a genuine photo of the accident, it will 
get published.

<b>selected press contacts</b>

<p>
Quite a number of news organizations made attempts to contact us
via e-mail. One was made prior to publication of the controversial
photo. C|Net was the first after the photo was published.
But it appears that the prestigious Agence France-Press broke the story 
over their wire service.
<p>
All attempts by the press to contact us were ignored. We had
made a decision to let the story develop on its own, rather than
try to put spin on it. As journalist Michael Lopp told a staffmember, 
"you are the king of ignoring all media".

  This is a wrong photo. The firemen don't have a french uniform and the

  18...

  Correct, it is a genuine accident image, very likely English.
  It hasn't been doctored, and is just coincidental that it appears
  superficially to be the Diana accident.

We got swamped!
<p>
For several months we were receiving 25,000 visitors per day. 
After 3 million visitors, rotten.com underwent a format change, and 
the number of visitors increased to about 35,000 per day. 
On September 17, there were about 50,000 visitors. Yesterday, 
after the media attention on September 18, we served 75,000 visitors.
<p>
But, prior to noon today, rotten had received 50,000 visitors and the
load average on the machine, a swank 4 processor sparc, was 95 (it's
normally 1/100th of that.)
<p>
The pictures have been removed for the time being. They have not
been censored; there is just not enough bandwidth for us to serve 
the demand. If you have a T3 and are willing to act as a mirror
site to shoulder a bit of this, please let our 
staff know in order to make arrangements.

Since the previous major media incident some months ago, significant bandwidth
