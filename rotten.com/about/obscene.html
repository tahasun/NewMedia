<h1>This site is under review</h1>
The definition of <b>obscenity</b>, according to the Supreme Court
and known informally as the <i>Miller test</i>, is:

<ul>
<li>must appeal to the prurient interest of the average person
<li>must describe sexual conduct in a way that is "patently offensive"
    to community standards, and
<li>when taken as a whole, it "must lack serious literary, artistic,
    political, or scientific value"
</ul>

<p>
Certain people (including parents and schoolteachers) have complained
to us and stated that rotten.com should not be "allowed" on the net, since
children can view images on our site.
<p>
One US schoolteacher wrote us a very angry email that complained some
of her students had bookmarked images on this site, that our site shouldn't
be on the net, and other claptrap.

This is our response. <b>The net is not a babysitter!</b> Children should not
be roaming the Internet unsupervised any more than they should be roaming
the streets of New York City unsupervised.
<p>
We cannot dumb the Internet down to the level of playground. Rotten dot
com serves as a beacon to demonstrate that censorship of the Internet is
impractical, unethical, and wrong. To censor this site, it is necessary
to censor medical texts, history texts, evidence rooms, courtrooms,
art museums, libraries, and other sources of information vital to
functioning of free society.
<p>
Nearly all of the images which we have online are not even prurient, and
would thus not fall under any definition of obscenity. Any images which
we have of a sexual nature are in a context which render them far from
obscene, in <i>any</i> United States jurisdiction. Some of the images may
be <b>offensive</b>, but that has never been a crime. Life is
sometimes offensive. You have to expect that.
<p>
The images we find most obscene are those of book burnings.
<p>
<mark>Please remember that <b>no child has access to the Internet without the
active consent of an adult.</b> And absolutely no child should be left
on the Internet alone. Supervision of children remains the responsibility
of parents and teachers, as it always has and always will.
